# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning - PoliMi
## Course Aim & Organization
Neural networks are mature, flexible, and powerful non-linear data-driven models that have successfully been applied to solve complex tasks in science and engineering. The advent of the deep learning paradigm, i.e., the use of (neural) network to simultaneously learn an optimal data representation and the corresponding model, has further boosted neural networks and the data-driven paradigm.

Nowadays, deep neural networks can outperform traditional hand-crafted algorithms, achieving human performance in solving many complex tasks, such as natural language processing, text modeling, gene expression modeling, and image recognition. The course provides a broad introduction to neural networks (NN), starting from the traditional feedforward (FFNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks, till the most successful deep-learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memories (LSTM).

The course's major goal is to provide students with the theoretical background and the practical skills to understand and use NN, and at the same time become familiar and with Deep Learning for solving complex engineering problems.

### Teachers
The course is composed of a blending of lectures and exercises by the course teachers and a teaching assistant.

- Matteo Matteucci and Giacomo Boracchi: the course teachers
- Francesco Lattari, Eugenio Lomurno, and Loris Giulivi: the course teaching assistants

### Course Program and Syllabus
This goal is pursued in the course by:

- Presenting major theoretical results underpinning NN (e.g., universal approx, vanishing/exploding gradient, etc.)
- Describing the most important algorithms for NN training (e.g., backpropagation, adaptive gradient algorithms, etc.)
- Illustrating the best practices on how to successfully train and use these models (e.g., dropout, data augmentation, etc.)
- Providing an overview of the most successful Deep Learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, sparse and dense autoencoder, LSTMs for sequence to sequence learning, etc.)
- Providing an overview of the most successful applications with particular emphasis on models for solving visual recognition tasks.
We have compiled a detailed syllabus of the course that students can use to double-check their preparation before the exam.

### Course Evaluation
Course evaluation is composed of two parts:

- A written examination covering the whole program graded up to 20/30
- 2 home projects in the form of a "Kaggle style" challenge practicing the topics of the course graded up to 5/30 each
The final score will sum up the grade of the written exam and the grade of the home projects. Home projects are not compulsory and they are issued only once a year.
